How It Works:
HTML: Sets up the basic structure with an input field, a button to add tasks, and a list (ul) to display tasks.
CSS: Styles the app and makes it responsive. It uses media queries to adjust the layout for mobile screens.
JavaScript:
addTask(): Adds a new task when the "Add Task" button is clicked or the "Enter" key is pressed.
toggleTaskCompletion(): Marks tasks as completed and allows toggling their completion status.
deleteTask(): Deletes tasks from the list.
localStorage: Stores tasks in the browserâ€™s local storage, so they persist across page reloads.
Features:
Add Task: Adds new tasks to the list.
Mark as Completed: Marks a task as completed, visually striking it through.
Delete Task: Deletes a task from the list.
Responsive: Adjusts layout for mobile and desktop views, providing a pleasant user experience on all screen sizes.
How to Run:
Create three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js in the same directory.
Open index.html in your web browser.
